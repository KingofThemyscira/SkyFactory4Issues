Downloaded 4.0.2 today and now my max sized compact chest (ComPatchedStorage) that is roughly 3/4 full of items is bugging out.  When opened you can access the items for about a half second or so and then they all disappear but are not gone.   WHem the chest is reopened the same thing happens over and over.
